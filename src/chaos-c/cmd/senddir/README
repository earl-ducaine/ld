This directory is for files that were ftp'd over from MIT-EDDIE
to serve for a better send server on September 6, 1984.
It was taken with the understanding that send would probably be
further developed at EDDIE.  If that be the case, then these
may be out of date.

The file libhosts.a should go into /usr/lib/libhosts.a
It is necessary to make a symbolic link from /usr/include/time.h
to /usr/include/sys/time.h as it was done on EDDIE.
The compiled files reply and send should go into /usr/local/bin.
A compiled newsends should go into /usr/local/bin too except
that the protection has to be set at "rwsr-xr-x" which you do
with a chmod 6755 newsends.  The directory  /usr/spool/sends should
have a protection of 777.  (This definitely works, other protections
may work, you can experiment.)

Type "make" when you are in this source directory to have everything
properly compiled.
