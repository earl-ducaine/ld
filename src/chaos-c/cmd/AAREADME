CHAOSNET
userland programs
original 9/8/98
updated 11/8/99

What was I thinking?

Most of this code is old and creaky.  It originally came from MIT.

To start the "server", load the chaosnet kernel driver, initialize
it and then start "chserver".  

Some client side programs I used to test functionality:

	chinit - init protocol stack
	cheaddr - set ethernet address
	cftp <servername>   - simple 'ftp like' file transfer program
	chtime <severname>  - gets time from lispm
	hostat <severname>  - gets packet stats from lispm

------ kernel -------

psuedo device connected to "/dev/chaos" fields ioctl's.
	CHIOCOPEN returns a new fd in user space
	CHIOCACCEPT accepts a new connection
	CHIOCREJECT rejects a new connection

psuedo device connected to "/dev/churfc" allows reads
	CHIOCILADDR to set choas address

driver needs to do open/close/ioctl/read/write and be able to create
new fd's in user space.

------ client programs -------

** These seem to work ok:

cftp
	chaos FILE protocol client; useful to test chserver + FILE

cheaddr
	sets address of specific ethernet interface

chinit
	init chaosnet protocol stack + set local host id

chtime
	time client; prints time on remote host (good test program)

hostat
	get net stats from chaos host

** These I have not debugged, they may or may not work:

chup
	uptime client

chfinger
	finger program

chmail
	chaosnet mail client for sending mail

checkalias
	checks email aliases?

chmkdev
	outputs mknod commands (for hard coded major/minor device #'s)

chrut
	route table maint?

chsend
	print a message on a logged in users terminal

chstat
	dig deep into kernel for protocol stack stats

chsupdup
	SUPDUP protocol client

chtape
	remote tape client

chtelnet
	telnet client

------ server programs -------

The basic chserve/FILE code seems to work for the QFILE protocol (not
NFILE).  I used it to transfer files back & forth with fep-tape.  

chserver
	listens on /dev/churfc

chttyserv
	tty server

chwrite
	send stream to remote host

chaccept
	called by chserver? accepts or rejects connection 
	(looks like it should be link from ACCEPT or REJECT command
	 for testing)

chconnect
	accepts connection, gets pty and forks login other half
	(puts up login prompt on remote connection)

chmailer
	chaosnet mail daemon

FILE
	QFILE protocol server
