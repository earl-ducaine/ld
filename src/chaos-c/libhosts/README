This directory contains two things:

1. A library of functions for manipulating host tables, which are included
   in programs that need it by specifying "-lhosts" when compiling.

2. Routines to generate a run-time loadable host table that also includes
   who the host we are running on is.

The hosttab.h file should be put into /usr/include and included in programs
using the library. This is done in "make install".

The hosts.global file should contain the currently distributed global
host table. "hosts.local" contains things to add to the host table for
hosts not in the global table but accessible from this host.
Normally, if you are not on the ARPA net, hosts.global is empty.

Look in hosts.sample for thr format of these files.

The file "whoami" contains the name of this host on one line, as found as the
primary name in the host table.  This name is the root of various host
dependencies so it should be done right.  The chaosnet code in the
kernel gets initialized at boot time with this name by the chinit program.

To summarize: to win you must make hosts.local hosts.global and whoami,
then run "make install" as super user.

New host tables can be found on mit-mc as the file

sysnet;hstmit

login as anonymous with any passwd

That table only includes mit hosts which is fine since all others must
be accessed with ip-tcp and not chaos.
